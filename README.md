- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vk4tdx. I got my nickname from one of the amateur radio license callsigns I've held. I started as VK4FRRW, then VKTDX, and am now VK2ENG
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in educating people in all forms of communications technology in order to stop people being taken advantage of and being manipulated.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to discover what to study. Technolgy evolves at a rapid pace, stable and reliable things are being abandoned on the daily. Hardware and software that is still viable is being dropped every day, leaving holes, leaving e-waste and this haunts me.
